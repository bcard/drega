# Vert.x Example Maven Project

TODO - these are the things that I still need to get done:

Need a way to enable/disable glitch avoidance
move all addresses to a single class to avoid typing errors
support simple arithmetic operations like y=x+1
Need to think about having multiple windows so we can have a distributed application
Should probably add a .get address for making a signal broadcast it's current value
Should not be able to define a signal that's already been defined

DONE Depdencency graph analysis to avoid glitches
DONE Numbering events, preforming dependency analysis on events
