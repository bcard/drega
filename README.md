# Vert.x Example Maven Project

TODO - these are the things that I still need to get done:

Should not be able to increment a mapped signal
Should not be able to define a signal that's already been defined
spaces for combine with add
when a new signal is create is needs to get the initial value of all dependent signals
move all addresses to a single class to avoid typing errors
Need a way to enable/disable glitch avoidance
support simple arithmetic operations like y=x+1
variables regex should not match numbers
Need to think about having multiple windows so we can have a distributed application
Should probably add a .get address for making a signal broadcast it's current value


---- Depdencency graph analysis to avoid glitches
---- Numbering events, preforming dependency analysis on events
