# Vert.x Example Maven Project

TODO - these are the things that I still need to get done:

Should not be able to increment a mapped signal
Should not be able to define a signal that's already been defined
Should not print out dependency graph when signal is created
Should not say signal has started until all dependencies have been recieved
Need a better way to showing values changing in symbols for demo
Need integration tests for new symbol features


---- Combine operator to combine multiple signals
---- Depdencency graph analysis to avoid glitches
